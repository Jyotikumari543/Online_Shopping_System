ONLINE SHOPPING SYSTEM

An online shopping system built using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) and JSP (JavaServer Pages) involves the use of Java for server-side logic, JSP for dynamic web page generation, and JDBC for interaction with the database. Below is an overview of how such a system could be structured:

Architecture:
Client-Side Interface:
The user interacts with the system through a web browser.
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to create the user interface, layout, and interactivity.

Server-Side Logic:
Java Servlets handle HTTP requests and responses. They process user input, interact with the database, and generate dynamic content.

Database:
JDBC is used to connect to the database, execute SQL queries, and retrieve or update data.
Stores information about products, users, orders, etc.
